# Remote Patient Monitoring

This is a Java-based remote patient monitoring system that I developed with 4 other people for one of the modules in my degree 'Programming 3'. The development version is located in a different repository owned by one of my teammates, which can be found here: https://github.com/simonoury/RemotePatientMonitoring/tree/Development. I have uploaded the final version here for the sake of viewing my work with ease.
